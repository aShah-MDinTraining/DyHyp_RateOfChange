# DyHyp, DyNA, Rate-of-Change models
DyHyp: Dynamic hypergraphs to model cross-tissue spread of inflammatory mediators over two consectuvie time points
DyNA: Dynamic network analysis to model intra-tissue correlated changes in inflammatory mediators over two consecutive time points
Rate-of-Change models: model the velocy of inflammatory mediators across tissues
